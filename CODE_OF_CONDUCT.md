### a code-learning app

_This document describes our team social contract for this project_
Reference Establishing Norms
**Roles**

- Taskmaster
- Gitmaster
- Testmaster
  **Daily process**
- Morning stand-up started by Taskmaster
  - New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
  - Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
- Pair program on assigned tasks
- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
- At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master
  **Team expectations**
- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
- Share the mic
- Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
- At least message the group when you change what you are working on
  **Issues**
- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:

1. Take 10-15 minute break
2. List out the pros / cons
3. Vote on it
4. If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor

- If you are frustrated
  - Take a walk or get some water
  - Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
  - Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate
